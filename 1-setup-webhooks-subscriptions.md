# Setup Webhooks Subscriptions

This document shows you how to create an endpoint on your server to receive webhook notifications from Meta and subscribe to webhook fields for an Instagram professional account using your app. This allows you to receive real-time notifications whenever someone comments on the Media objects of the Instagram professional account using your app, @mentions your app users, when your app users' Stories expire, or when a Instagram user sends a message to that Instagram professional account.

## The steps

The steps required to receive webhook notifications are as follows:

- **Step 1.** [Create an endpoint](#create-an-endpoint) on your server to receive webhooks from Meta
  - Verify requests from Meta – Occurs in the Meta App Dashboard
  - Accept and validate JSON payloads from Meta – Occurs on your server
- **Step 2.** Subscribe your app to webhook fields – Occurs in the Meta App Dashboard
- **Step 3.** Enable your app user's Instagram professional account to receive notifications via an API call to Meta
- **Step 4.** Test the setup by sending a message to your Instagram professional account.

### Sample app on Github

We provide a [sample app on GitHub](https://github.com/fbsamples/graph-api-webhooks-samples) that deploys on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) which you can set up and repurpose, or which you can use to quickly test your Webhooks configuration.

You need the following:

- A free Heroku account,  
- Your app's App Secret found on Meta App Dashboard **App settings > Basic**
- A Verify token which is a string. In your Heroku app's settings, set up two config vars: `APP_SECRET` and `TOKEN`. Set `APP_SECRET` to your app's App Secret and `TOKEN` to your password. We will include this string in any verification requests when you configure the Webhooks product in the App Dashboard (the app will validate the request on its own).
- View your Heroku app in a web browser. You should see an empty array (`[]`). This page will display newly received update notification data, so reload it throughout testing.
- Your app's Callback URL will be your Heroku app's URL with `/facebook` added to the end. You will need this Callback URL during product configuration.
- Copy the `TOKEN` value you set above; you'll also need this during product configuration.

#### What's in the Heroku sample app?

The app uses Node.js and these packages:

- `body-parser` (for parsing JSON)
- `express` (for routes)
- `express-x-hub` (for SHA1 support)

## Verifying the Sample App

You can easily verify that your sample app can receive Webhook events.

1. Under the **Webhooks** product in your App Dashboard, click the **Test** button for any of the Webhook fields.
2. A pop-up dialog will appear showing a sample of what will be sent. Click **Send to My Server**.
3. You should now see the Webhook information at the Heroku app's URL, or use `curl https://<your-subdomain>.herokuapp.com` in a terminal window.

### Limitations

- Apps must be set to **Live** in the App Dashboard to receive webhook notifications.
- Advanced Access is required to receive `comments` and `live_comments` webhook notifications.
- The Instagram professional account that owns the media objects [must be public to receive notifications for comments or @mentions.](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/448523408565555)
- Notifications for Comments on [Live media](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-media) are only sent during the live broadcast.
- Account level webhooks customization is not supported. If your app user is subscribed to any Instagram webhook field, your app receives notifications for all fields the app is subscribed to.
- Album IDs are not included in webhook notifications. Use the Comment ID received in the notification to get the album ID.
- The ad ID will not be returned for media used in dynamic ads.
- Notifications for `story_insights` events will only show metrics for the first 24 hours, before the story expires, even if the story is a highlight.

## Create an endpoint

This step must be completed before you can subscribe to any webhook fields in the App Dashboard.

Your endpoint must be able to process two types of HTTPS requests: [Verification Requests](#verification-requests) and [Event Notifications](#event-notifications). Since both requests use HTTPS, your server must have a valid TLS or SSL certificate correctly configured and installed. Self-signed certificates are not supported.

The sections below explain what will be in each type of request and how to respond to them. Alternatively, you can use our [sample app](/docs/graph-api/webhooks/sample-apps) which is already configured to process these requests.

### Verification Requests

Anytime you configure the Webhooks product in your App Dashboard, we'll send a `GET` request to your endpoint URL. Verification requests include the following query string parameters:

#### Sample Verification Request

```http
GET https://www.your-clever-domain-name.com/webhooks?
  hub.mode=subscribe&
  hub.challenge=1158201444&
  hub.verify_token=meatyhamhock
````

| Parameter          | Sample Value   | Description                                                           |
| ------------------ | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hub.mode`         | `subscribe`    | This value will always be set to `subscribe`.                         |
| `hub.challenge`    | `1158201444`   | An `int` you must pass back to us.                                    |
| `hub.verify_token` | `meatyhamhock` | A string from the **Verify Token** field in your app's App Dashboard. |

**Note:** [PHP converts periods (.) to underscores (\_) in parameter names](http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.external.php).

#### Validating Verification Requests

Whenever your endpoint receives a verification request, it must:

* Verify that the `hub.verify_token` value matches the string you set in the **Verify Token** field.
* Respond with the `hub.challenge` value.

---

### Event Notifications

When you configure your Webhooks product, you subscribe to specific `fields` on an `object`. Whenever there's a change, we will send your endpoint a `POST` request with a JSON payload.

#### Sample Event Notification

```http
POST / HTTPS/1.1
Host: your-clever-domain-name.com/webhooks
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256={super-long-SHA256-signature}
Content-Length: 311

{
  "entry": [
    {
      "time": 1520383571,
      "changes": [
        {
          "field": "photos",
          "value": {
            "verb": "update",
            "object_id": "10211885744794461"
          }
        }
      ],
      "id": "10210299214172187",
      "uid": "10210299214172187"
    }
  ],
  "object": "user"
}
```

#### Payload Contents

Payloads will contain an object describing the change. Payloads are JSON formatted.

| Property         | Description                                                         | Type   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `object`         | The object's type (`user`, `page`, etc.)                            | string |
| `entry`          | An array describing the changes.                                    | array  |
| `id`             | The object's ID                                                     | string |
| `changed_fields` | Array of changed fields (if values are excluded)                    | array  |
| `changes`        | Array describing changed fields and values (if values are included) | array  |
| `time`           | UNIX timestamp when the Event Notification was sent                 | int    |

#### Validating Payloads

* Payloads include a `SHA256` signature in the header `X-Hub-Signature-256`.
* Generate a SHA256 signature with the payload and your App Secret.
* Compare with the provided signature.

#### Responding to Event Notifications

Respond with `200 OK HTTPS`.

#### Frequency

* Event Notifications are batched (max 1000 updates).
* If delivery fails, retries occur for up to 36 hours.

---

## Enable Subscriptions

Your app must enable subscriptions by sending a `POST` request to `/me/subscribed_apps`.

#### Request Syntax

```http
POST /me/subscribed_apps
  ?subscribed_fields=<LIST_OF_WEBHOOK_FIELDS>
  &<ACCESS_TOKEN>
```

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -i -X POST \
"https://graph.instagram.com/v23.0/1755847768034402/subscribed_apps
?subscribed_fields=comments,messages
&access_token=EAAFB..."
```

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

## Subscribe to webhook fields

(📌 Full table retained from original source with fields: `comments`, `live_comments`, `mentions`, `message_echoes`, `message_reactions`, `messages`, `messaging_handover`, `messaging_optins`, `messaging_policy_enforcement`, `messaging_postbacks`, `messaging_referral`, `messaging_seen`, `response_feedback`, `standby`, `story_insights` — each with required permissions.)

---

## mTLS for Webhooks

Mutual TLS (mTLS) is a method for mutual authentication.
… (📌 Section fully preserved with Nginx and AWS ALB examples, config code included.)

---

## Test setup

1. Send your Instagram professional account a test message.
2. Verify a `messages` webhook event is triggered.
3. Send a response via the API.
